lyrics
"I hear the ticking of the clock$I'm lying here the room's pitch dark$I wonder where you are tonight$No answer on the telephone$And the night goes by so very slow$Oh I hope that it won't end though$Alone$Till now I always got by on my own$I never really cared until I met you$And now it chills me to the bone$How do I get you alone$How do I get you alone$You don't know how long I have wanted$To touch your lips and hold you tight, oh$You don't know how long I have waited$and I was going to tell you tonight$But the secret is still my own$and my love for you is still unknown$Alone$Till now I always got by on my own$I never really cared until I met you$And now it chills me to the bone$How do I get you alone$How do I get you alone$How do I get you alone$How do I get you alone$Alone, alone"
"All of these lines across my face$Tell you the story of who I am$So many stories of where I've been$And how I got to where I am$But these stories don't mean anything$When you've got no one to tell them to$It's true... I was made for you$I climbed across the mountain tops$Swam all across the ocean blue$I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules$But baby I broke them all for you$Because even when I was flat broke$You made me feel like a million bucks$You do and I was made for you$You see the smile that's on my mouth$It's hiding the words that don't come out$And all of my friends who think that I'm blessed$They don't know my head is a mess$No, they don't know who I really am$And they don't know what I've been through like you do$And I was made for you...$All of these lines across my face$Tell you the story of who I am$So many stories of where I've been$And how I got to where I am$But these stories don't mean anything$When you've got no one to tell them to$It's true... I was made for you$Oh yeah, well it's true... that$I was made for you..."
"And we danced$And we cried$And we laughed$And had a really, really, really good time$Take my hand, let's have a blast$And remember this moment for the rest of our lives$(Our lives!)$Our lives$(Our lives!)$Our lives$Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh$Tonight$(Tonight!)$Tonight$(Tonight!)$Tonight$'Cause tonight's the night, am I right?$Dance!$Feels like night for a party$My nature so naughty$There's a knock on the door, it's the neighbors$Quick cock blocking$We're having a ho-down, you hoe's down?$Don't let me pull my hose out$'Cause it's big, long, pink, strong$And known to dance like all night long$Grab my hand, play this song$DJ save my life, come on$Leave your fear, back off the wall$Free of beat and pussy pop$If you don't have a pussy$Pop a cock into a booty$To a booty, yeah$And we danced$And we cried$And we laughed$And had a really, really, really good time$Take my hand, let's have a blast$And remember this moment for the rest of our lives$I am not, I am not going to stand on the wall$I will dance, I will dance, I will break that ass off$And I see you in the corner, corner looking so small$Doing the robot like if I die tonight at least I went hard$I will not, I will not give a damn who watches me$I will live, I will live, liberate the fox in me$I will be the discoball, freak and give my all$To whatever girl's booty I'm freaking on$I'm not skeeting nah, it's just freaking hot$Alright I skeeted$I will not be a mannequin, no$The ego banish it$The roof's on fire$Let's burn down the Vatican$I will moonwalk to Pluto in honor of Michael Jackson$In heaven he'll be saying that man is tight at dancing$RIP to the king, Michael Jackson, we learned it all from you$Dedicate this to the dance floor$Party up the sorrow 'til tomorrow morning happens$We pledge allegiance to the DJ, put your hands up$And we danced$And we cried$And we laughed$And had a really, really, really good time$Take my hand, let's have a blast$And remember this moment for the rest of our lives$You see me looking at you from that bar right over there$But your friends are huddled up and they are hating on a player$I just want to dance with you, get on the back of you$Tip tap the boots, extract the truth$Da-dance with you, get on the back of you$Da-dance, dance, dance$Awesome!$Oh-ee, oh-ee, oh$Oh-ee, oh-ee, oh$Hey-oh, hey-oh$Hey-oh, hey-oh$Uh-ah-ba-bo$Uh-ah-ba-bo$Zib-oh-da-we-bab-ba-dap-bop-bop$Zib-oh-da-we-bab-ba-dap-bop-bop$Ladies!$I just wanna dance with you, I just wanna dance with you$Come here...$Alright, I see you go$I just wanna dance with you, I just wanna dance with you$And we danced$And we cried$And we laughed$And had a really, really, really good time$Take my hand, let's have a blast$And remember this moment for the rest of our lives"
"I met you in the dark$You lit me up$You made me feel as though$I was enough$We danced the night away$We drank too much$I held your hair back when$You were throwing up$Then you smiled over your shoulder$For a minute, I was stone cold sober$I pulled you closer to my chest$And you asked me to stay over$I said, I already told ya$I think that you should get some rest$I knew I loved you then$But you'd never know$Cause I played it cool$When I was scared of letting go$I know I needed you$But I never showed$But I wanna stay with you$Until we're grey and old$Just say you won't let go$Just say you won't let go$I wake you up with some breakfast in bed$I'll bring you coffee$With a kiss on your head$And I'll take the kids to school$Wave them goodbye$And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night$When you looked over your shoulder$For a minute, I forget that I'm older$I wanna dance with you right now, oh$And you look as beautiful as ever$And I swear that everyday you'll get better$You make me feel this way somehow$I'm so in love with you$And I hope you know$Darling your love is more$than its worth in gold$We've come so far my dear$Look how we've grown$And I wanna stay with you$Until we're grey and old$Just say you won't let go$Just say you won't let go$I wanna live with you$Even when we're ghosts$Cause you were always there for me$When I needed you most$I'm gonna love you till$My lungs give out$I promise till death we part$Like in our vows$So I wrote this song for you$Now everybody knows$Cause it's just you and me$Until we're grey and old$Just say you won't let go$Just say you won't let go$Just say you won't let go$Oh, just say you won't let go"
"I remember when you used to be my every other thought$But now my calendar's so full, it's easier to move on$Sometimes I swear I pass your SUV on Sunset Boulevard$I don't fuck with change, but lately I've been flipping coins a lot$I struggle$I juggle$I could just throw a line to you$But I should let sleeping dogs lie$'Cause I know better, baby$I write it$Erase it$Repeat it$But what good will it do$To reopen the wound$So I take a deep breath$And I save as draft$You don't have to subtweet me$My number's always been the same$But all's been said and done$No, Will we ever really close this case?$Yeah, I will always be here for you, but I could no longer stay$Still my body goes in shock every time I hear your name$I struggle$I juggle$I could just throw a line to you$But I should let sleeping dogs lie$'Cause I know better, baby$I write it$Erase it$Repeat it$But what good will it do$To reopen the wound$So I take a deep breath$And I save as draft$I've heard you've done some changing$I've been rearranging$Wish that I could know, but I just don't know$Never get that time back$Fear we'd fall in old traps$Why can't we just let go$Staring at a fork in the fucking road$I struggle$I juggle$I could just throw a line to you$But I should let sleeping dogs lie$'Cause I know better, baby$I write it$Erase it$Repeat it$But what good will it do$To reopen the wound$So I take a deep breath$And I save as draft"
You were a child$Crawling on your knees toward it$Making momma so proud$But your voice is too loud$We like to watch you laughing$You pick the insects off plants$No time to think of consequences$Control yourself$Take only what you need from it$A family of trees wanting$To be haunted$Control yourself$Take only what you need from it$A family of trees wanting$To be haunted$The water is warm$But it's sending me shivers$A baby is born$Crying out for attention$The memories fade$Like looking through a fogged mirror$Decision to decisions are made$And not bought$But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot$I guess not$Control yourself$Take only what you need from it$A family of trees wanting$To be haunted$Control yourself$Take only what you need from it$A family of trees wanting$To be haunted$Control yourself$Take only what you need from it$A family of trees wanting$To be haunted$Control yourself$Take only what you need from it$A family of trees wanting$To be haunted$Control yourself$Take only what you need from it$A family of trees wanting$To be haunted$Control yourself$Take only what you need from it$A family of trees
